Outstanding Tasks:

1. The buffer size in the HttpServletRequest.wrap() method is hard coded to 
   33049 bytes. This might not be enough. Need to test with a large dataset.
   We may need to incrementally increase the buffersize if we hit a buffer
   overflow.

2. Need to set up a timer task to periodically clean up HttpSessions.

3. Confirm implementation/scope of cookies:
   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie

4. Check all public implementations of the java.io.InputStream. If a read()
   returns a -1 all subsequent read() requests should return -1.

5. Need to implement the following methods in HttpServletRequest:
   - getCharacterEncoding() <--test it!!
   - getRequestURL() <-- test it!!!
   - getRequestDispatcher()
   - isUserInRole()

6. Need to implement the following methods in HttpServletResponse:
   - addHeader()
   - setLocale() - Simply sets the class variable which isn't used for anything.
   - encodeURL() - Implement session management via URLs



Enhancements:

1. Implement handler for TE Header

2. Implement mechanism to block DoS attacks
